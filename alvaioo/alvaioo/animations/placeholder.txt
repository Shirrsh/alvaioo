This folder would typically contain Lottie JSON animation files if you were hosting them locally.

Example:
animations/
  hero-animation.json
  chatbot-flow.json
  data-processing.json

For this project, Lottie animation URLs are sourced from CDNs (like LottieFiles) and are defined in src/constants.tsx.
This approach simplifies setup and leverages CDN benefits. If custom or private animations are needed, they would be placed here and referenced locally.
